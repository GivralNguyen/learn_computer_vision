"""
Example code of how to use the TensorBoard in PyTorch.
This code uses a lot of different functions from TensorBoard
and tries to have them all in a compact way, it might not be
super clear exactly what calls does what, for that I recommend
watching the YouTube video.
Video explanation: https://youtu.be/RLqsxWaQdHE
Got any questions leave a comment on youtube :)
