"""
A simple walkthrough of how to code a fully connected neural network
using the PyTorch library. For demonstration we train it on the very
common MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. In this code we go through
how to create the network as well as initialize a loss function, optimizer,
check accuracy and more.
